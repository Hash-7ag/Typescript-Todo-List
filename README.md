## Entry #1

I am already close to finishing the course, and here are my current thoughts:

It was clear from the beginning that it would be impossible to fully cover **TypeScript**, **React**, and **Tailwind CSS** within a single course. However, since my main goal was to practice **TypeScript**, I focused on analyzing how TypeScript works specifically in a React environment.

Still, I was not fully satisfied with the course because the amount of educational explanation felt quite limited. The course works well as a practical guide for building a **Todo List project** using these three tools, but in terms of deep learning and theory, the content is rather minimal.

For now, I won’t give any final recommendations. I plan to finish the remaining parts tomorrow and then reflect on the overall experience.

At the end, I will share my final opinion and conclusions — what I learned, whether the course was worth it, and what value it provided.

At the moment, I am short on time, so I will complete the remaining tasks tomorrow.
