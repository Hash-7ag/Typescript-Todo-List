This learning project is based on the video course by the author of the **[Coding in Flow](https://www.youtube.com/@codinginflow)** YouTube channel.

## 📺 About the Course

- **[Link to the full course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siTUv1L9ymM)**
- The course covers a modern development stack:

  - **React** — Library for building user interfaces
  - **TypeScript** — Typed JavaScript
  - **Tailwind CSS** — Utility-first CSS framework
  - **Vite** — Fast build tool

## 📝 My Notes and Comments

During the learning process, I record my thoughts, questions, and points for discussion. All of them are documented in this README file.

## Entry #1

I am already close to finishing the course, and here are my current thoughts:

It was clear from the beginning that it would be impossible to fully cover **TypeScript**, **React**, and **Tailwind CSS** within a single course. However, since my main goal was to practice **TypeScript**, I focused on analyzing how TypeScript works specifically in a React environment.

Still, I was not fully satisfied with the course because the amount of educational explanation felt quite limited. The course works well as a practical guide for building a **Todo List project** using these three tools, but in terms of deep learning and theory, the content is rather minimal.

For now, I won’t give any final recommendations. I plan to finish the remaining parts tomorrow and then reflect on the overall experience.

At the end, I will share my final opinion and conclusions — what I learned, whether the course was worth it, and what value it provided.

At the moment, I am short on time, so I will complete the remaining tasks tomorrow.

## Entry #2

It has already been **three days** since I wrote my last comments. I finished the course **two days ago**, and today I have **almost completely finalized the project**.

### What I implemented:

- **Responsive design**
- **User-friendly UI/UX**
- **Data persistence using LocalStorage**

Now, regarding the course itself — it is an **excellent course for getting familiar with and understanding how the core technologies work**:

- **React**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Vite**
- **TypeScript**

Since I was already familiar with React, it wasn’t difficult for me to understand how everything works together. However, I did not fully master **TypeScript**, and getting acquainted with it was my main priority while watching this course.

In my first entry, I mentioned that this course is not very strong as a _teaching_ course. After finishing it, I realized that this statement was **not entirely correct**. The course is not meant to be a deep educational resource — instead, it is an **introductory and practice-oriented course**.

This course is especially suitable for people who are just starting to learn, for example, **TypeScript**, but already have a solid foundation. During learning, they encounter new concepts such as different variable types, the `tsconfig` file, and other terms and mechanisms that do not exist in plain JavaScript. This course provides a great opportunity for such learners to **practice**, gain confidence, and then continue studying the required topics in more depth.

Although I used TypeScript as the main example here, the same idea applies to the other three core tools used in this project (**Vite, React, and Tailwind CSS**).

Additionally, I discovered **Lucide React** during this project. It is a very convenient library for using clean and beautiful icons, similar to React Icons. However, it felt more lightweight and comfortable to use, especially for smaller projects.

I will not create full code documentation, as you can watch the course yourself and compare it with my implementation. My code does not differ significantly from the original one — only minor changes related to design and small details.
